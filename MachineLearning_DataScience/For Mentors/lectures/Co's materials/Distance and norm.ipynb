    "- **Defition**: a function $||\\cdot||:X\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^+$ that also defines a non-negative numerical value for each element in the vector space $X$, intuitively, it measures the distance between an element and the origin. Hence, we have mostly the same properties as a distance for norm.\n",

    "- **Euclidean**: the most popular type of norm/distance function in real world as well as in the academic literature which is defined as for $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "$$d(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(|x_i-y_i|^2\\right)^{1/2}$$\n",

    "$$||\\overline{x}||_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(|\\overline{x}_i|^2\\right)^{1/2}$$\n",
    "It is also called $L_2$ norm or root mean squared error (rmse).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Absolute value**: the norm/distance function is defined solely based on the absolute value\n",
    "$$d(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|$$\n",
    "$$||\\overline{x}||_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\overline{x}_i|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Notes: it is also called **Manhattan/Taxi-cab distance/$L_1$/mean absolute error**\n",
    "- **Minkowski**: is a metric in a normed vector space which can be considered as a generalization of both the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance. It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski and is defined with $p\\geq 1$\n",
